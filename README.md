# vue-iframemodal
Modal popup for html iframe that has dynamic zoom and screen size, for VueJS

No CSS needed - Vue computed functions provide styles.

Sliders exist for zoom, width, and height.  Wheel controls zoom, but rescales limits on height and width sliders.

Link in header loads the iframe into a new browser tab.
